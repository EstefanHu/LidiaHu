        <Paragraph>
          On a late summer afternoon, three sisters spent time outside their farmhouse while their parents were away. The youngest, who was four years old, twirled and twirled. Her cornflower blue dress puffed into a bell shape as her loose blonde curls waved in the air. She seemed to not have a care in the world.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Keeping watch, Marie, the oldest sister, sat reading on the front porch steps. Without looking up, she said, &quot;Macie, stop twirling. You might make yourself sick like Maggie did last week.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Maggie, the middle sister, stood on the porch rail. &quot;What?&quot; She wrapped her left arm around the post and tilted away from the pole. &quot;Twirling doesn&apos;t make you throw up. It helps to get rid of bad feelings.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie raised an eyebrow at Maggie, shook her head then continued to read.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Maggie jumped, landing in front of her older sister. A dust cloud rose between them. She dusted her overalls, tightened her strawberry blonde curly ponytail and said, &quot;It&apos;s what you cooked that upset my stomach.&quot; Maggie turned and ran towards the swing on the maple tree.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Waving the dust away from her face, Marie yelled, &quot;It wasn&apos;t my cooking; it was Mom&apos;s. Maybe if you hadn&apos;t eaten all the bread pudding your stomach would not have swollen like a pumpkin. You didn&apos;t even leave any for Macie or me. Your overeating created cramps that caused you to get sick. You wasted Mom&apos;s delicious goodness.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;I bet the coyotes loved her vomit,&quot; Macie said as she came and sat next to Marie. &quot;It was all gone the next day.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;It sure was.&quot; Marie responded as she turned the page. She felt a tug on her sleeve. &quot;Yes, Little Princess, what do you need?&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;I&apos;m sad.&quot; Macie whispered with a tiny voice in her sister&apos;s ear.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;What? You&apos;re sad?&quot; Marie placed the book beside her, lifted her little sister onto her lap and said, &quot;Little Princes look at me.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Macie looked at Marie. Her blue eyes had a hint of sadness.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Concerned, Marie told her little sister, &quot;You were twirling joyfully. What could have caused you to suddenly be sad, Little Princess?&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          With her head on Marie&apos;s chest, she whispered again, &quot;I don&apos;t want you or Maggie to go to school. I don&apos;t want to be left alone. Who will play with me?&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Why are you using your fairy voice to speak to me?&quot; Marie tilted her head closer to Macie&apos;s rounded face.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Macie cupped her hands around her mouth and softly said, &quot;I&apos;m afraid the bad fairy will hear me and keep this feeling inside me. I don&apos;t like it. I was twirling to get it out of my heart.&quot; She slid off her sister&apos;s lap, her eyes lit up like twinkling stars and said, &quot;I wish for a little brother to play with when you and Maggie will be gone.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Maggie swung on the tire swing. She yelled, &quot;What are you two talking about?&quot; She jumped off the swing and ran to her sisters. &quot;What&apos;s the matter Macie? Your long face can reach all the way to the tree.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Our little sister wants a baby brother to keep her company when we go back to school.&quot; Marie informed Maggie.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Well, that&apos;s impossible. Mom and Dad can&apos;t just pop a baby out in two weeks.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie kicked Maggie&apos;s shin.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Ouch. That hurt! What was that for?&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;For using the word <i>impossible</i>. We Joneses believe in miracles and wishes. Why don&apos;t we help Macie make a wish? Let&apos;s go to the tree.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Rubbing her leg Maggie led the way. &quot;Sis, you&apos;re right. Which I do not like. I suppose God has a particularly good reason for you to be older than me. I&apos;m mad at him. I will always be three years behind you. I know, I shouldn&apos;t be upset at God.&quot; Maggie kicked a rock and mumbled, &quot;Why can I be the big sister, and boss you around.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>

          Marie took Macie&apos;s small hand. &quot;Little Princess. Let&apos;s go make your wish under the magic maple tree. Maggie, you need to twirl around and spin your bitterness out of her heart.&quot; She chuckled.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Ha, ha.&quot; Maggie pretended to laugh.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Can we make sure the bad fairy isn&apos;t around?&quot; Macie asked as she hugged her big sister&apos;s arm.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Maggie walked backwards, faced her sisters and said, &quot;Don&apos;t worry Little Princess. While we are in the position of making upside down wishes, I&apos;ll light the fairy torches. She doesn&apos;t like light. Then, we&apos;ll ride the dragonflies and announce that we, the three Joneses girls have entered the Kingdom of Twinkling Stars. Which she can&apos;t enter. And I, the clever thirteen-year-old that I am, will lead the way.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          All three sisters sat down, faced each other and held hands.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Maggie continued, &quot;Once the bad fairy knows we&apos;re there, she&apos;ll tuck away her puny wings and hide. You&apos;ll see Little Princess.&quot; Maggie released her little sister&apos;s hand, picked up a twig and lifted it up high. &quot;This is my torch and . . .&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;What if she doesn&apos;t tuck her wings and hide?&quot; Macie timidly interrupted.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Well then, I&apos;ll blow my magic horn and call for reinforcements.&quot; Maggie rolled her empty hand and blew musical sounds through the hole her fingers made.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Alright girls. Let&apos;s take the steps to make our wishes heard. First, we turn over and lay on our tummies. Our feet must touch. Hands on the ground, push yourself up and then back with our butts in the air.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Yes, fearless leader,&quot; Maggie commented. &quot;Let&apos;s climb onto our invisible dragonfly.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie continued, &quot;Now lift your right foot to the sky.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Little Princess poked Marie on the arm. &quot;Sis, which is my right foot?&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;This one,&quot; Maggie tapped Macie&apos;s right foot.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; Macie raised her skinny leg up high.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;What on earth are you girls doing?&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie looked up and saw her mother. &quot;We&apos;re helping Macie make a wish.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;I see. When you&apos;re done, your father and I need to talk to you all.&quot; Her mother&apos;s dressy maroon shoes glistened in the late sun as she walked back to the house.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <i>I&apos;m glad they&apos;re back. Why did she wear her nice shoes? She must have gone to an important meeting.</i> Marie ignored her curiosity and instructed her sisters, &quot;Now, repeat after me, star high, star bright.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Star high, star bright.&quot; The other two sisters repeated.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie added, &quot;Please make our wish come true by our third night.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Maggie chimed the chant after Marie.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Please make my wish come tonight,&quot; Marcie yelled,
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Maggie and Marie giggled.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie gave more directions, &quot;Let&apos;s put our leg down and close our eyes. In our hearts and minds, let&apos;s say the wish and ask the fairies to take it beyond the stars. When we are done, we say, ‘Tickle me,&apos; or else our wish may not come true.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Silence hovered under the tree.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Tickle me.&quot; Macie yelled the phrase before her sisters.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Maggie and Marie tickled their little sister. Macie&apos;s laughter filled the atmosphere. Her pale face turned bright red.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Their mother hollered, &quot;That&apos;s enough girls.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The girls stopped.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          In a much calmer voice the mother added, &quot;Come. Your dad and I have something important to tell you.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie noticed her father standing by the porch as she walked behind her sisters. &quot;Hello Father.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          He winked, smiled, and sat on the porch swing next to his wife and said, &quot;Girls, we like to know how you may feel about a change in our lives. I will let your mother tell you about it.&quot; He placed his armed around their mother, &quot;Go ahead, Honey.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          All three girls sat on rocking chairs.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <i>They&apos;re happy. I wonder what great news they must tell us.</i>
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The mother cleared her throat, held her husband&apos;s hand and said, &quot;We are adopting a little boy.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Holy Cow! Macaroni.&quot; Margie screamed as she jumped up, placed her hands on her head and paced around. &quot;I can&apos;t believe this is happening. No, it can&apos;t be happening.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          With her heart almost pumping out of her chest, Marie asked,&quot; Is this for real?&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          With a happy laugh her mother answered, &quot;Yes.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Macie sat speechless with the most confused expression.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie stood up, lifted her little sister in the air and twirled her around. &quot;Your wish came true, Little Princes. Your wish came true.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Maggie embraced Marie. &quot;Miracles and wishes do come true for the Joneses.&quot; She quickly asked, &quot;Does this boy come with a dog? Cause, I ‘ve wished for a dog many times. Please say yes.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The father asked, &quot;Do you girls want a dog to care for along with a baby brother?&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          All three girls hollered, &quot;Yes!&quot; Their joyous energy rippled around them.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          A soft wind caused the chimes to play their music. Birds chirped as they flew away from the tree. And the evening sun glowed warmly.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Well then, we&apos;ll have to see about a dog.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie asked, &quot;If it&apos;s no trouble, could I have a cat?&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Oh my.&quot; Their mother covered her mouth.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;That&apos;s fine, a boy and a dog are enough to add to this family,&quot; Marie put her wish back into her heart&apos;s pocket and adjusted her shorts.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;No, don&apos;t be quick to put your wish away. Our friend, Ms. Vergerson, youngest granddaughter, has developed an allergy to Zoomer, her cat, and wanted to know if we would adopt it.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Maggie exclaimed, &quot;No way! This is im-. No, it&apos;s happening. It is possible.&quot; She took Marie&apos;s hand. They pranced around with Macie in Marie&apos;s arms. They huddled, giggled and hugged.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie whispered, &quot;See Sis, we Joneses believe _&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;In miracles.&quot; Maggie screamed.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The father&apos;s cellphone rang.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Hello. Yes. Of course. I&apos;ll be right over. Well girls, I&apos;m grateful you are happy with the news. I need to attend to some matters.&quot; The father placed his phone back in his pocket. &quot;Sorry, Honey. I must go.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Don&apos;t worry Babe, I will give the girls the details and dates,&quot; Their mother stood and gave him a kiss.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marcie looked at Maggie. &quot;See, Mommy and Daddy can pop out a baby in two weeks.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Everyone but Macie laughed.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Chuckling the father said, &quot;I&apos;m not sure what that&apos;s all about, but it was funny. Bye girls.&quot; He waved as he walked to the driveway.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Marie and Maggie make sure you two teach Macie who is the real miracle worker and makes wishes come true.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Both girls answered, &quot;yes, Mother.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;It&apos;s time to fix dinner. Come inside and I&apos;ll tell you more about your new brother.&quot; The mother walked into the house, &quot;By the way, his name is Max&quot;.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Goodness gracious.&quot; Maggie yipped and followed her mother. &quot;No way, four M&apos;s. This is a trip for my brain.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Macie said, &quot;I think I&apos;m going to pee my pants.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Hurry, go to the bathroom,&quot; her mother commanded.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Macie ran into the house.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Don&apos;t forget to wash your hands,&quot; the mother hollered.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie held her mother&apos;s arm. &quot;Mom, he&apos;s going to fit in this family, perfectly.&quot;
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          &quot;Yes, he will. Why else would God give him to us.&quot; her mother replied.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Marie noticed Her mother&apos;s blue eyes sparkled. They were full of joy. She knew how much she wanted a little boy but couldn&apos;t have any more children since her cancer surgery.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Closing the screen door Marie looked back at the Maple tree then gazed to the sky. <i>Lord, Mom is right, you&apos;re the true miracle worker and wish maker. You tickle me with your goodness. Thank you for granting our desires. Help me to always delight in you.</i>
