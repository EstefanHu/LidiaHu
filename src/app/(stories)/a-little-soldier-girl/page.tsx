      <Title>A Little Soldier Girl</Title>
      <Paragraph>&quot;What do you think, sweetie? Is this the one?&quot; Hannah and her four-year-old child stood in front of a bird cage. In silence she prayed. Lord, please help us find the bird my daughter dreamt about. It would be helpful to have a new melody to help us during these challenging mornings.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Camile, her little  girl, looked intently at a bird nesting in the corner of a cage. Her golden-brown ponytail was the only thing that announced to the world that she was a girl. She wore desert storm camouflage pants, a coffee-cream t-shirt, small combat boots and her father&apos;s cap which was two sizes too big. The cap went wherever she went. It became her security blanket two weeks ago, after her father gave his life in Iraq.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Yes, mommy this is the one!&quot; Camile answered with a bubbly voice.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>A high school clerk standing-by overheard the girl and said. &quot;This bird is not for sale.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Why not?&quot; Hannah asked with a low spirited voice.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;He&apos;s hurt.&quot; The teen boy looked at the young mother and mouthed the words, &quot;He&apos;s dying.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;What happened to him? Camile asked without taking her little chocolate eyes away from the bird.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The clerk squatted and told the four year old, &quot;Little soldier girl, this tiny bird began behaving strangely after his two bird friends were sold. They were like brothers. Three days ago we found him very weak stuck in between the cage bars. I think he was trying to escape and find his friends.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Can I hold him?&quot; asked Camile.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Avoiding the question, the clerk stood up and directed the mother to other birds. &quot;Let me show you some birds which could be a possible purchase.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The teen eager to sell a bird told the young mom about the type of birds that could be a good match for her and her daughter as they walked by the bird-filled cages.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Camile followed quietly, took off her father&apos;s cap to see the birds better. She handed the cap to her mother. A few birds slept, some sang cheerful songs while others flew in their cage revealing their brilliant colors.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Would you care to see any of these birds?&quot; The clerk asked the little soldier girl.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Camile pulled on her mother&apos;s purse whispering in a meek voice, &quot;Mommy these are not the ones.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Upon noticing her little girl&apos;s sad face Hannah pleaded, &quot;Young man, could you kindly show us the bird in the back of the store.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The young man lifted his shoulders and said as he led the way, &quot;Sure, I guess it won&apos;t hurt.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Once by the cage, the teen reached and picked up a small olive colored round ball of feathers. The bird kept his beak tucked under his wing as he was transported. Cupped in the clerk&apos;s hands the young man informed the mother, &quot;Typically birds wake easily, take flight, and make it a challenge to be caught. This one doesn&apos;t seem to care.&quot; The clerk placed the bird in Camile&apos;s hands. &quot;Be careful. Don&apos;t hold him too tight. The bird will not fly away because he has a damaged wing.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The clerk excused himself to help another customer.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Camile sat on the floor with her legs crossed. Her right index finger caressed the tiny bird tenderly. She lifted him up to see his face. Her exhale breath caused the ball of feathers to puff up. Slowly the bird raised his head slightly and turned to look at who held him.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>A gleam of hope shone from Camile&apos;s eyes. &quot;Don&apos;t worry little bird!  You&apos;re going home with us today.&quot; She assured the bird with her tender voice.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Mommy, this is the bird that daddy told me about in my dreams. I remember because he said it would have a hurt wing. Here he is waiting for me. Just like Daddy said he would.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Hannah ringed her husband&apos;s cap as she contained sorrow in her heart. &quot;Yes, sweetheart, you told me he would have a hurt wing.&quot; Nervously, she walked back and forth looking for the clerk, but he was at the register with a customer.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>An elderly gentleman wearing an apron and carrying a bucket of soapy water asked, &quot;Can I help you?&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>With a trembling voice, Hannah spoke timidly. &quot;Yes, my little girl and I…&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Could you please speak louder? I&apos;m having a difficult time hearing you,&quot; the old man hollered as he placed the bucket down and adjusted his hearing aid.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Camile&apos;s mother took a deep breath, composed herself, and then continued, &quot;I&apos;ve been to all the pet stores in the area looking for a particular bird. Here he is, but he&apos;s not for sale! I need to know if there is anyway….&quot; She ringed the cap harder as if she was trying to squeeze words out of it.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>A tear sparkled at the corner of her eyes as she continued. &quot;My daughter had a dream about a bird.&quot; She paused. &quot;Her father, my husband…&quot; she bit her lower quivering lip &quot;…gave his life in Iraq.&quot; She released a deep sigh and wiped her nose with a Kleenex that she held.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;My condolences. I&apos;m a survivor of WWII. I understand your pain. I see you have more to say, please continue.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;You see, my daughter woke-up without her usual smile for a few mornings after we learned that her father had passed. At breakfast that same morning, she kept talking about her daddy and a bird. I didn&apos;t really listen to the whole thing. I thought this was just her way of dealing with the loss.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Until last night when she reminded me how we needed to find the bird.&quot; The widow cleared the tears that rested on her cheek. &quot;I thought if I buy a bird it might help her.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;We&apos;ve been to every pet shop in the area and didn&apos;t find the bird she wanted. This is the last place and…&quot; Camile pulled on her purse, interrupting her.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Mommy, this little bird will keep us company now that daddy is in heaven. We&apos;ll sing songs together like daddy used to sing with us every morning.&quot; Camile announced joyfully. She Began singing, &quot;You are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when skies are gray…&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The olive-colored bird lifted his head higher, ruffled his feathers revealing his burnt orange chest. Then, he chirped a most beautiful melody joining little Camile.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The old man was startled upon hearing the mesmerizing singing. Within seconds the high school clerk joined them. He stood speechless.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Did you know he could sing this well?&quot; The old man asked.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;No?&quot; the word almost didn&apos;t leave the clerk&apos;s lips.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;It&apos;s unbelievable how your little girl and the bird are in harmony. I&apos;m the owner. Let me see what I can do. This bird is going home with you today.&quot; The astonished store owner commented.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;I thought he was near death.&quot; The teen blurred out.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Hannah got goosebumps, rubbed her arms and said, &quot;My husband sang this song each morning to us, weeks before being deployed.&quot; Joyful tears flowed from her light brown eyes as she held her husband&apos;s cap close to her heart.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Mommy, in my dream, Daddy whispered in my ear. He told me to bring the hurt bird home and to tell him his job. He&apos;s going to sing with me in the morning. Daddy said, not to worry about him. I know why, because God is going to heal his wing. Just like he has healed daddy.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Just then the bird started chirping again, little Maria joined him with her singing filling the store with healing music.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>The young mother swallowed the lump of pain in her throat, &quot;How much for the bird?&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Without hesitation, the owner responded, &quot;He&apos;s free, no cost to you! It&apos;s evident that this bird must go home with this little warrior. We&apos;ve never heard this bird sing such a heavenly melody, until now. He&apos;s definitely a special gift reserved by God for your little girl.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;You see Ms this bird is a Peking Nightingale. They&apos;re known for serenading the sun at the break of dawn with their charming song. It&apos;s believed, they&apos;re sun worshippers. Knowing your husband sang with you all in the morning, that is good enough for me. Johnny go find them a cage and a bag of food.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Thank you. Thank you. How can I ever repay you for your generosity.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;This little girl&apos;s father paid with his life. The cage and bird seed are my gift of gratitude for his service.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;Camile, did you hear? He&apos;s coming home with us. He&apos;s ours.&quot; The young mom&apos;s enthusiasm reached her daughter&apos;s ears.</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>&quot;I&apos;m so happy. Mommy, my heart knew he was ours. But now my head knows it too.&quot; Camile stood up and held the cupped bird close to her chest. &quot;You&apos;re ours. And we&apos;ll sing together. Don&apos;t worry, God will heal your wind, just like he healed my daddy in heaven.&quot;</Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>Grateful words escaped Hannah&apos;s lips, &quot;Thank you Lord for the new song coming into our home and lifting our hearts.&quot;</Paragraph>
