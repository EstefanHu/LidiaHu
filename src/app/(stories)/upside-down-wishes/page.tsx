      <Paragraph>
        On a late summer afternoon, three sisters spent time outside their farmhouse while their parents were away. The youngest, who was four years old, twirled and twirled. Her cornflower blue dress puffed into a bell shape as her loose blonde curls waved in the air. She seemed to not have a care in the world.

        Keeping watch, Marie, the oldest sister, sat reading on the front porch steps. Without looking up, she said, &quot;Macie, stop twirling. You might make yourself sick like Maggid did last week.&apos;

        Maggie, the middle sister, stood on the porch rail. &quot;What?&quot; She wrapped her left arm around the post and tilted away from the pole. &quot;Twirling doesn&apos;t make you throw up. It helps to get rid of bad feelings.&quot;
